# CloudCannon Astro Starter

A minimal starter template for building an Astro site with [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) using **Editable Regions** for visual editing.

## Features

- Visual editing with [Editable Regions](https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/developer-guides/set-up-visual-editing/an-overview-of-editable-regions/) (text, image, array, and component regions)
- Page building with reusable components
- Blog with pagination and tags
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) with CSS-first configuration
- SEO controls
- Pagefind search

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## CloudCannon Setup

This site is pre-configured for CloudCannon. Connect your repository and CloudCannon will detect the configuration from `cloudcannon.config.yml`.

### Editable Regions

This starter demonstrates several types of Editable Region:

- **Text** (`data-editable="text"`) for editing front matter text values inline
- **Image** (`data-editable="image"`) for editing front matter image values
- **Array** (`data-editable="array"`) for page-building with reorderable content blocks
- **Component** (`<editable-component>`) for live re-rendering of Astro components

Components that need live re-rendering are registered in `src/scripts/register-components.ts` and loaded conditionally when the site is open in CloudCannon's Visual Editor.

#### Source Editables

The About page (`src/content/pages/about.astro`) demonstrates **source editables** — a pattern where content lives directly in an Astro template rather than in Markdown front matter. Source editable regions use `data-editable="source"`, `data-path="path/to/file.astro"`, and `data-key` attributes, and CloudCannon writes changes straight back to the `.astro` file.

This is useful for standalone pages (like About or Contact) where a developer wants full control over the markup while still giving editors visual editing access, and where page building with components is *not* desired. No accompanying Markdown file or front matter schema is needed; a thin routing wrapper in `src/pages/about.astro` handles Astro's file-based routing.

### Components

Three page-building components are included:

- **Hero** — heading, subheading, image, and optional button
- **LeftRight** — side-by-side text and image, with optional flip and button
- **TextBlock** — heading and rich text content

### Content

- **Pages** are in `src/content/pages/` as Markdown with structured front matter
- **Blog posts** are in `src/content/blog/` as MDX
- **Data** files (site settings, navigation) are in `data/`
